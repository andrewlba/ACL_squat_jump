## Squat Identification
1. Total Jump Start-When movement begins (before Jump)
2. Total Jump End-When movement ends (after Landing)
3. Eccentric phase-Start of loading to concentric peak
4. Concentric phase-Concentric peak to when force = 0
5. Landing-Second peak in jump curve to when movement ends

## Squat Calculations

1. Jump height from takeoff velocity (cm)-v^2/2g
2. Rate of force development during eccentric phase (N/s)/Normalized rate (BW/s)-Loading rate during eccentric phase
3. Jump time (s)-Starts from beginning of loading/eccentric phase and ends when patient is in the air
4. Eccentric phase time (s)
5. Concentric phase time (s)
6. Flight time (s)-Time when force = 0
7. Peak force (N)/Normalized (BW)
8. Peak power (W)/Normalized (W/kg)-Find velocity and multiple by Force 
9. Average power during concentric phase (W)/Normazlied (W/kg)
10. Countermovement/Squat depth (cm)-Difference between standing and lowest depth (double integrate)
11. Maximum center of pressure displacement in A-P direction (x-direction) during concentric phase (cm)
12. Maximum center of pressure displacement in M-L direction (z-direction) during concentric phase (cm)

## Visual metrics
1. (animation) COP of each foot vs time
2. (animation) Force magnitude in a 3D space vs time

## Additional Calculations 

1. Concentric Force (N)
2. Landing Force (N)
3. Eccentric Time: Jump Time Ratio
